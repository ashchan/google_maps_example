Sample codes from the book [Beginning Google Maps Applications with Rails and Ajax: From Novice to Professional](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Google-Maps-Applications-Rails/dp/1590597877)

This sample is of Rails 2.1, using Sqlite3.

The source code from the book has some typos, and some of them don't work. I've tried my best to make the it work.

The Chinese translation of the book sucks, see http://blog.ashchan.com/archive/2008/06/25/professional-book/ .
